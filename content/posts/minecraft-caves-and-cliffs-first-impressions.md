##### Let's welcome the brand new Minecraft Update: Caves and Cliffs Update!

<!--more-->

**Y**esterday, Mojang Studios announced the new Minecraft update that will completely change the world. The Caves and Cliffs Update focuses on Cave Generation that has been the most wanted update by far, it also adds the Mountains that are voted from 2019 Minecon Live.

This update is the most awaited update for Minecraft for years, as such, Mojang stated that they carefully planned this update for years ensuring every type of player will get something for this update. I actually am geniunely wowed and jaw-dropped as they revealed the title of the update. This update is the greatest most feature-packed update since I played Minecraft 8 years ago.

# First Impressions

I was surprised and excited when they announced the update and its features. For a couple of minutes, I was speechless due to the amazing way that they showed and delivered the most anticipated update. The way that the caves generate reminded me of some mods back in the golden years of modding. (In my opinion of course..) I think as a Game Development Studio, Mojang Studios listens intently and works together with the community to provide an experience that is acceptable to the players, not just forcing anyone to just accept whatever changes the game will do to your player experience.

I think they revitalized the community that is yearning for more Overworld changes and brings the community excitement and curiosity to what is comming. I trully think that the community of Minecraft worldwide wondered and marveled at the sheer size of the upcomming update.

The Mob Vote was an interesting one, I voted for the Glow Squid 'coz I prefer it against a glorified cow (Moo Bloom, no offense :) ). I voted against the Iceloger one because although its interesting, I don't want a repeat of the Phantom last Minecon [Year?]. I don't want to regret my choice later on. The Glow Squid won! So, I can't wait to see what they will do to it, only time will tell.

Minecraft is a game that keep evolving over the years, even from when I started with my cousin, It continued to evolve to become a wonder and a marvelous experience to us players and players-to-be. Minecraft is a Sandbox Game of infinite opportunities, you can do anything that comes to your imagination. It is such an experience with a game design that is endearing to me as a gamer and to others who play the game. It creates limitless possibilities that many can relate, it creates the idea that you can be whatever you want to be. It also gives you an authentic Survival experience that will continually be enjoyed by everyone.

Here's to more Minecraft! :)

# The Caves and Cliffs Update Revealed Features:
![Caves](null "Caves")
## Caves

Caves are a new improved feature of the upcomming update. From Small Caves to Huge Caverns. They also implemented local water levels for Underground Water Caves, it also provides natural waterfalls underground. Cave Shapes and Sizes are completely biome independent but it scales up according to the terrain above.

![Lush Caves](null "Lush Caves")
#### Lush Caves

This Wonderful Cave Biome features moss-looking green blocks, vines, new plants and it feels lively. 
It brings a new dimension to the grey and monotonous caves that we are used to. It creates a luscious environment that encourages builders to create their own luscious and green environments on the ground.

![Axolotls](null "Axolotls")
#### Axolotls

This new ugly-cute mob will definitely will become your best friend in exploring the depths of the ocean. They live in the Lush Caves but you can scoop them out with a bucket to bring them to the ocean as your companoin as they will attack sea creatures from the cute fishes to the scary Guardians. They have a behavior that when they are hit, they play dead for a moment to regen their health. This prevents the from being attacked. They can also heal you if you learn to 'cooperate' with them. (or whatever that means.)

![Dripstone Caves](null "Dripstone Caves")
#### Dripstone Caves

The Dripstone Caves is a new cave biome that adds Stalactite and Stalagmite. For Stalactites that have water drops, you can place a Cauldron below it for water.
It mixes the wonders of a real life underground cave to Minecraft.

![The Dark Deep](null "Dark Deep")
## Dark Deep
There are no info on where the dark deep is at the momment, maybe in the Deep Oceans perhaps? Though the footage they showed us does not show any water or ocean like features. It brings a new scary part of the game where you are rewarded to explore but contains dangers for the Late game players.

![Sculk Sensors](null "Sculk Sensors")
#### Sculk Sensors
These are blocks can detect vibrations of anything that moves, placed blocks, any block movement, etc. You can use wools for blocking vibrations reaching the Sculk Sensor. It can be used in a certain way to have Wireless Redstone. I am sure it will crank up the imagination of Redstone and Technical Engineers of Minecraft to the extreme with these block and what possibilities that they bring to the core Minecraft experience that will surely tickle the minds of them for years.

![The Warden](null "The Warden")
#### Warden
This is the first blind mob in Minecraft. It sees using vibrations and it resides in the dark deep. You need to sneak and be very quiet. These are a Scary-cute looking mob. You are warned if the warden is approaching by the lights dimming like in a horror movie. You can distract this mob by making vibrations from snowballs or eggs. It is very dangerous and deals with a large damage even with a full Netherite Armour.

## Other New Blocks and Items

![Amethyst Geodes](null "Amethyst Geodes")
#### Amethyst Geodes
This block generates in a specific place and can be used for making a Telescope.

![Telescope](null "Telescope")
#### Telescope
This is a new item that enables players to zoom.

![Lightning Rod](null "Lightning Rod")
#### Lightning Rod
This new block captures the lightning so it won't destroy your flammable stuff.

![Copper Ore](null "Copper Ore")
#### Copper Ores
This new ore is different from the existing ores whereas the ore does not generate lika a blob but like a real ore vein whereas it scatters the ores a bit.

![Copper](null "Copper")
#### Copper Blocks (All Variants like Block, Slab, Stairs, etc)
Copper Blocks will age overtime turning to Turquoise Green, so it shows builds that are old.

![Bundles](null "Bundles")
### Bundles
Bundles are a new item that allows you to store multiple stacks of items to efficently bring them wherever you go.



![Archeology](null "Archeology")
## Archeology

Archeology meets Minecraft. This is a new system where generated Archeology sites that you can find throughout the world. It provides a new way for playing that realistically resembles real life Archeology. This is actually a surprising addition to Minecraft, but I can see the point they are trying to make. They want Minecraft to not only be enjoyed but to be learned on as they base somethings in real life. You can really impact a person's life by teaching them while they are playing and are having fun while doing it. It shows that theyy want to impact lives of their players in good and educative way.

![Brush](null "Brush")
#### Brush
The Brush will slowly reveal hidden artifacts and blocks that are part of Minecraft's history and lore. Be careful though, fast brushing will destroy the artifact just like real life where if you are not careful enough, you can destroy old artifacts that are unique and priceless.

![Clay Pot](null "Clay Pot")
#### Clay Pot
Clay Pots can be customized by clay pieces found in the Archeology Site. You can fit pieces as you wish and when you're done, light the bottom of the clay with fire. 
These provide depth to the lore of Minecraft where they include bits and pieces of story that is based on real life archeology.
