Hello World; A statement of welcoming the new.

<!--more-->

In Programming, a Hello World is a typical starting point of any Programming Projects. It is actually included in most books and tutorials, especially the words "Lorem ipsum".

This is a new beginning for my website, I abandoned wordpress as it required me a server. I changed the backbone of my entire website. This wild ride that I went through was fun. Even I made many discoveries myself.
It is a short post but it starts a whole new chapter for my life.

"Hello World"
