Windows was my first but I am ready for change. My journey was fun (at least for me) and challenging, it taught me many things about computers in general. To be clear: I am changing my main Operating System.

Join me as I navigate the rabbit hole that is Linux.

Since I was 6 years old, I always use Windows for the Desktops and Laptops. From Windows XP all the way to Windows 10. It was a wonderful experience.
Windows has provided me a great platform to use for my early Java Programming back in 2015 using Eclipse IDE. I always use Microsoft Office for any school work that requires it.

I switched to Linux last March 2020, It was a hard decision but I decided to dual-boot my laptop with Ubuntu 20.04. It was great at first, but I eventually changed my 'distro' to Pop OS!, and then ElementaryOS and back to Ubuntu 20.04. The one thing I hated from Ubuntu and Ubuntu-based Distributions is that you need to add repos if you want latest stuff. I get it, stability and all but it was janky at best.

I then found Arch Linux back in June 2020. Arch Linux is a rolling release, meaning you get the bleeding edge software. Arch offers fresh from source software but it comes in with caveats, like bugs and the probability of a broken system. Arch is for advanced Linux users. I searched for Arch-based Distributions and I found Manjaro. Manjaro is a 'distro' that is stable, unlike Arch which is directly from source, Manjaro Stable tests and releases software that are good enough for public use. I finally switched to Manjaro.

Distributions are an integral part of the Linux System and so is Desktop Environment or DE. DEs are what you see as a user. Unlike Windows which only has Windows Explorer Shell as its DE, Linux has many including GNOME, Plasma KDE, Cinnamon, and many more. GNOME is the default DE of Ubuntu, I used it for a while when I was using Ubuntu, but its not for me. GNOME is radically different from Windows. I am not comfortable with using GNOME so I tried different ones, settling for Plasma KDE.

A Linux Experience is not complete without the Terminal. This is the heart of the operating system. You can do pretty much every operation in the terminal: copy, paste, rename, install apps, and many more. I enjoy using the Terminal when installing software, I don't know why but it's satisfying. 

When using Debian/Ubuntu, use:

```shell
sudo apt-get install <program>
```

When using Arch/Manjaro, use:

```shell
sudo pacman -S <program>
#or if you have Pamac:
sudo pamac install <program>
```

Using Linux was a little difficult at first but I just searched it. For example renaming stuff via the terminal uses the mv (move) command. For example:

```shell
mv file1.txt file2.txt
```

I have been using Linux for 6 months and I have enjoyed my time with Linux. I still use Windows but only for Office and some stuff.
